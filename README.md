# OpenSearch.org website update

The OpenSearch.org website is now hosted on infrastructure provided by the Linux Foundation. Unfortunately, we can no longer accept contributions to the codebase in the form of a pull request.  A special thank you to the community for the years of insight and collaboration.  

We continue to make use of the project-website repository for several things. Please take note: 

* Feel free to file bug reports and feature requests as usual if you find something broken and/or missing. 
* For content additions such as new blogs, or becoming a new solutions provider, please use the appropriate issue template. 
* For anything not covered, please use the blank issue template and let us know as descriptively as possible how we can help you.
